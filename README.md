# ComplyLayer

**Pluggable compliance rules and decision engine for fintechs.**

A decision API a fintech calls before finalising any transaction. It returns `allow`, `flag` or
`block` in under 100 milliseconds, based on rules the compliance officer writes and edits
themselves — no engineer, no pull request, no deploy.

> The person who owns the regulatory risk should be able to change the control without filing a
> ticket.

**Status: planning complete, phase 0 in progress.** Nothing here serves a decision yet.

## Documents

| Document | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`docs/product-specification.md`](docs/product-specification.md) | The full product specification — business analysis, architecture, security, operations |
| [`docs/plan-architecture.md`](docs/plan-architecture.md) | The decisions the specification leaves open, resolved, with their costs stated |
| [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) | Nine phases, each with a mechanically checkable exit gate |
| [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) | Architecture decision records |

## The parts worth reading first

- **[ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-ast-interpreter-not-eval.md)** — why rules are interpreted over a
  validated AST and never `eval`. This is the security core of the product; the obvious
  implementation is remote code execution offered as a feature.
- **[The latency budget](docs/plan-architecture.md#latency-budget-restated-with-the-omissions-filled-in)**
  — 100 ms p99, itemised by stage, including the two costs the specification's own budget omitted.
- **[Fail-open versus fail-closed](docs/product-specification.md)** §10.3 — the failure mode is a
  product decision made per rule severity, recorded and alerted on, rather than an accident nobody
  stated out loud.
